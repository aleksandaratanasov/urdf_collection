*.dae are fixed up versions of the Collada meshes in the 'meshes/kr3cr' dir.

*_obj.dae are fixed up (and converted) versions of the obj meshes in the
'meshes/kr3cr' dir.

Both sets have the same origins for all meshes (ie: at zero-point of joint).

The *.dae meshes have (lots of) inconsistent normals.

The '*_obj.dae' meshes are of higher (visual) quality.
